### Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Neuroscience** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I am fascinated by understanding how biological neural systems work and leveraging these insights to build more intelligent AI systems.

**Current Research Focus:**
- **Connectomics & Neural Control**: Developing brain-inspired controllers using whole-brain connectome data (flyGM project)
- **Large Language Models**: Evaluating and improving LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks (SOP-Maze benchmark)
- **Vision-Language Models**: Researching agentic strategies for multimodal AI systems

### Professional Experience

- **Keeta (Meituan) · LongCat LLM Team** (Sept 2025 - Dec 2025)
  - Machine Learning Research Intern, Shanghai, China
  - Deployed and evaluated vision-language models (VLM) and Vision-Language-Action models (VLA)
  - Designed benchmarking pipelines for production-ready VLM/VLA evaluation

- **Infplane AI** (Jun 2024 - Jun 2025)
  - Cofounder & Machine Learning Engineer, Beijing, China
  - Pre-trained and finetuned LLMs using Megatron-LM and NVIDIA NeMo Framework
  - Developed automated hyperparameter optimization algorithms for LLM training
