### Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Neuroscience**. I am fascinated by understanding how biological neural systems work and leveraging these insights to build more intelligent AI systems.

**Research Interests:**
- **Efficient High-Performance LLMs**: Building scalable and efficient large language models, potentially inspired by principles from neuroscience
- **AI and Neuroscience**: Exploring the synergy between artificial intelligence and biological neural systems
- **Vision-Language Models**: Developing multimodal AI systems including Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Vision-Language-Action models (VLA)


### Professional Experience

- **Keeta (Meituan) · LongCat LLM Team** (Sept 2025 - Dec 2025)
  - Machine Learning Research Intern, Shanghai, China
  - Deployed and evaluated vision-language models (VLM) and Vision-Language-Action models (VLA)
  - Designed benchmarking pipelines for production-ready VLM/VLA evaluation

- **Infplane AI** (Jun 2024 - Jun 2025)
  - Cofounder, Beijing, China
  - Pre-trained and finetuned LLMs using Megatron-LM and NVIDIA NeMo Framework
  - Developed automated hyperparameter optimization algorithms for LLM training
